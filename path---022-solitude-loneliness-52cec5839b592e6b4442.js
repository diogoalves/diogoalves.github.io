You can be the most extroverted person on the planet and still feel lonely, or you can be an introvert with a few close friends and feel fulfilled.” In other words, it’s all about choices: Feeling stuck in your own solitude may set you up for unhappiness, but spending time alone simply because you want to won’t have the same effect.</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Solitude and Loneliness",date:"January 12, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/022-solitude-loneliness/"}}}});
